# Pronghorn Repository Instructions

## Mission and Architecture
- Pronghorn is an AI-assisted software platform with a React + Vite frontend and a TypeScript Express API backend.
- Architecture: Direct **Web App → API** communication. The frontend calls the API endpoints directly.
- API architecture:
	- Versioned API under `/api/v1/*`
	- OpenAPI at `/api/openapi.json`
	- Swagger UI at `/api-docs`
	- WebSocket endpoint at `/ws`

## UI/UX Layout Contract (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The redesign is the layout contract (Constitution Principle VI, v2.1.0):
- **`app/frontend-new/`** (the new frontend, spec `specs/007-frontend-new/`): follow `specs/007-frontend-new/contracts/design-system.md` and the prototypes in `docs/design/frontend-redesign/`. New layouts, navigation and page structure that follow the contract ARE permitted. Changes to the contract itself update the contract and the prototypes in the same pull request.

## Repository Layout (Authoritative)
- Frontend app: `app/frontend-new/src/`
- API service: `app/backend/src/`
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform): `infra/`
- SQL migrations: `infra/migrations/`
- Static/public data and prompt templates: `public/data/`
- Docs and migration references: `docs/`, `README.md`, `docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`

## Layer-Scoped Development
This repository uses layer-scoped instruction files (`.github/instructions/`) that auto-attach based on which files you're editing:
- **`frontend-new.instructions.md`** → `app/frontend-new/**` — new frontend (redesign): layout contract, move-and-restyle recipe, tokens only
- **`api.instructions.md`** → `api/**` — Express/PostgreSQL/JWT, versioned routes (mapped to `app/backend/**` after restructure)
- **`infra.instructions.md`** → `infra/**` — Terraform/Azure modules
- **`cicd.instructions.md`** → `.github/workflows/**` — GitHub Actions

## MCP Servers Available

## Tech Stack and Tooling
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Query, React Router.
- Backend: Node 18+, Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL (`pg`), `ws`, Swagger, JWT middleware.
- Infra: Terraform modules for Azure resources (APIM, Container Apps, PostgreSQL, Foundry, Key Vault, Storage, etc.).
- Package manager in repo scripts is `npm` (despite `bun.lockb` existing in root).

## Local Dev Commands

- **Full stack** (from repo root):
	- `npm install` (one-time — installs `concurrently`)
	- `npm run dev` (starts databases + API + frontend in one terminal)
	- `npm run dev:stop` (stops database containers)
	- `npm run dev:reset` (wipes database volumes and recreates)
	- `npm run build` (builds backend then frontend)
	- `npm run test` (runs Jest + Vitest)
- Frontend (`app/frontend-new/`):
	- `npm install`
	- `npm run dev` (Vite on port 8080)
	- `npm run build`
	- `npm run lint`
- API (`app/backend/`):
	- `npm install`
	- `npm run dev` (ts-node + nodemon)
	- `npm run build`
	- `npm run start`
- Databases: `docker-compose.yml` runs `db` (port 5432) and `db-generated-apps` (port 5433) only. API and frontend run natively via npm.

## Coding Rules
- Keep changes minimal and task-focused; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Prefer existing project patterns over introducing new abstractions.
- Preserve API versioning and route organization under `app/backend/src/routes/`.
- Use the existing `@` alias (`@/* -> src/*`) in frontend imports where appropriate.
- Follow existing Tailwind token/theme usage; do not hard-code new design tokens when existing variables/utilities cover the need.
- Do not add new dependencies unless necessary and justified by the task.
- Commit regularly with clear messages; avoid large, monolithic commits.
- use TDD where practical. Write tests for new features and bug fixes, and ensure existing tests pass.

## PowerShell Script Conventions (Enforced)
For any new or modified PowerShell scripts (`*.ps1`, `*.psm1`) in this repository, follow these authoritative sources:

- PowerShell Script Analyzer (official rules and style enforcement):
	- https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/utility-modules/psscriptanalyzer/overview
	- https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/master/RuleDocumentation
- Microsoft Learn language references:
	- Comment-based help (headers/help/commenting): https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comment_based_help
	- Functions and parameter conventions: https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_functions_advanced_parameters
	- Approved verbs: https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_verbs

Required conventions for this repo:
- Include a script/function help header using comment-based help (`.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.PARAMETER`, `.EXAMPLE`) for scripts/functions that are intended for reuse.
- Use `param(...)` with explicit parameter names/types, validation attributes where appropriate, and meaningful defaults.
- Prefer approved verb-noun naming for functions.
- Use 4-space indentation, consistent brace style, and no trailing whitespace.
- Keep comments focused on intent/usage (not obvious line-by-line narration).
- Favor early validation and fail-fast error handling (`$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` where appropriate).

When practical, validate PowerShell changes with PSScriptAnalyzer before considering the task complete.

## Function Authoring Requirements
When writing or modifying functions (frontend or backend):
- Add descriptive JSDoc comments.
- Include input validation.
- Use early returns for error/guard conditions.
- Use meaningful, non-trivial variable names.
- Include at least one example usage in comments where practical.

## Backend-Specific Guidance
- Keep middleware ordering intact (security, CORS, body parsing, logging, routes, error handler).
- Maintain compatibility with current auth/JWT approach and existing headers (`Authorization`, `apikey`, `ocp-apim-subscription-key`, etc.).
- For DB changes, update SQL migrations in `infra/migrations/` rather than ad-hoc runtime schema changes.
- For API additions, prefer versioned endpoints in `app/backend/src/routes/v1` and keep OpenAPI/Swagger alignment.

## Frontend-Specific Guidance
- Reuse existing components and utilities from `app/frontend-new/src/components`, `app/frontend-new/src/lib`, `app/frontend-new/src/hooks`, and `app/frontend-new/src/utils` before creating new primitives.
- Keep state/data-fetching patterns consistent with existing React Query and context usage.
- Respect MSAL/Azure auth integration and existing environment-variable driven configuration.

## Infrastructure and Azure Guidance
- Prefer modifying existing Terraform modules and variables under `infra/` instead of creating parallel infra definitions.
- Keep APIM/Container Apps/PostgreSQL/Foundry integration assumptions consistent with current architecture.
- Never commit secrets, keys, tokens, or real credentials; use env vars and examples.

## Validation Expectations for Changes
- For frontend-only changes: run `npm run lint` in `app/frontend-new/`, then `npm run build` when feasible.
- For API-only changes: run `npm run build` in `app/backend/`.
- For cross-cutting changes: validate both `app/frontend-new/` and `app/backend/` builds.
- If behavior depends on database objects, verify against `infra/migrations/001_full_schema.sql` expectations.

## Documentation and Consistency
- Update relevant docs (`README.md`, `LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md`, or `docs/*`) when behavior, commands, or architecture change.

## Example SKILL.md Structure
Use this structure as a template when creating new skill documentation files:

### Front matter:

```yaml
---
name: <name-of-skill>
description: <brief description of the skill and its purpose>
argument-hint: <optional hint for user input when invoking the skill>
compatibility:
  - linux
  - macos
  - windows
license: MIT
user-invokable: true
---
```

### Review SKILL.md instructions
- Follow the structure and sections as outlined in existing `SKILL.md` files under `.github/skills/<skill-name>`.
- Ensure all required sections (e.g., Pre-requisites, Steps, Validation) are included and clearly written.

### Read template
- Review existing template in `templates/*.md` if applicable to the type of document or artifact you are creating.

### Execute scripts
- If the task involves running scripts, ensure you understand the commands and their effects before execution.
- Follow any pre-requisites or setup steps outlined in the documentation before running scripts.
- For inline scripts use script blocks in documentation for clarity and reproducibility.
- Run file based scripts in `scripts/<script-name.ext>` and verify their successful execution.

### Produce document
- Create document in `docs/<topic>/<document-name>.md` if applicable, following the structure and style of existing documentation in the repository.

### Produce artifact
- Create artifact based on the template format and structure and place it in `artifacts/<artifact-name>.md` if applicable.

### Validate artifact
- Run validation: `python scripts/check_runbook.py docs/<topic>/<document-name>.md`

### Must Include (functional requirements)
- **Pre-requisites**: Required conditions, permissions, or resources needed before execution.
- **Trigger**: Conditions or events that activate the runbook, script, tool, process or operation.
- **Impact**: Business and system impact if the issue is not resolved
- **Mitigation**: Step-by-step actions to address the issue
- **Rollback**: Procedures to revert changes if needed
- **Ownership**: Team or individual responsible for managing the task or process
- **Validation**: How to confirm the task was successful and the issue is resolved

## What to Avoid (examples of anti-patterns)
- Do not bypass existing auth/authorization checks in API handlers.
- Do not hardcode environment-specific URLs in source unless already patterned that way for local dev defaults.
- Do not deviate from the UI/UX layout contract in `app/frontend-new/`. Contract changes update the contract and the prototypes in the same pull request.
