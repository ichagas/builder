# Test All — Full Stack Test Suite

## Pre-requisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- `npm install` completed in both `app/frontend-new/` and `app/backend/`
- For API tests: local PostgreSQL running (or mock configuration)

## Steps

1. **Run frontend tests** (`app/frontend-new/` — Vitest):
   ```bash
   cd app/frontend-new && npm test
   ```

2. **Run API tests** (`app/backend/` — Jest):
   ```bash
   cd app/backend && npm test
   ```

## Validation
- Both test suites must pass (exit code 0).
- Review coverage output for any significant drops.
- Failed tests must be investigated — do not suppress failures.

## Trigger
- Before creating a pull request.
- After modifying business logic in `app/frontend-new/src/` or `app/backend/src/`.
- As part of the testing agent workflow.

## Rollback
- N/A — this is a read-only validation skill.

## Ownership
- Development team — all contributors.
