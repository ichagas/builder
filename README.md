# Pronghorn (Alpha)

**Build Software with AI-Powered Precision**

A standards-first, agentic AI platform that transforms unstructured requirements into production-ready code with complete traceability. From idea to deployment, Pronghorn orchestrates multi-agent AI teams to design, build, and ship software autonomously.

## Overview

Pronghorn is an open-source AI-powered software development platform created by the **Government of Alberta, Ministry of Technology and Innovation**. It enables teams to take an idea from design through to deployment using coordinated AI agents.

The platform operates in four modes:

| Mode        | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Design**  | Visual specification building with an interactive canvas     |
| **Audit**   | Multi-agent cross-comparison between project datasets        |
| **Build**   | Autonomous code generation with real-time monitoring         |
| **Present** | AI-generated project presentations                           |

## Frontend redesign in progress

`app/frontend/` is being superseded by a redesigned frontend under active development at `app/frontend-new/` (see `specs/007-frontend-new/`). As of this pre-go-live pivot, **`app/frontend/` receives no more feature work** — it is kept only as the regression reference (visual/behavioral parity baseline) until `app/frontend-new/` cuts over and replaces it as the production frontend. Bug fixes required to keep the regression baseline meaningful are still permitted in `app/frontend/`; new features and redesign work belong in `app/frontend-new/`.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Requirements & Standards** — Decompose ideas into Epics, Features, User Stories, and Acceptance Criteria linked to a reusable global standards library and organizational build books
- **Visual Architecture Design** — Interactive React Flow canvas with 24+ node types, layer management, and lasso selection
- **Multi-Agent AI Teams** — Orchestrated specialists (Architect, Developer, DBA, Security, QA, DevOps, UX, and more) collaborate on the canvas and generate production code with full Git workflow
- **Audit & Analysis** — Cognitive cross-comparison between project datasets with Evidence Grid, Knowledge Graph, and Venn Diagram outputs
- **Collaborative Editing & Sharing** — Real-time AI-assisted document editing, a project gallery with one-click cloning, and token-based sharing (Owner / Editor / Viewer) with no login required
- **Database Management** — PostgreSQL lifecycle tooling with schema explorer, Monaco SQL editor, and AI-powered data import

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and **npm**
- **Docker Desktop** (for local PostgreSQL databases)
- **Git**

> For Azure deployment you will also need: Azure CLI, Terraform, and PowerShell 7+. See the [Infrastructure README](./infra/README.md) and the deployment guides under [`docs/`](./docs).

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install root dependencies (one-time)
npm install

# 2. Install frontend and backend dependencies
npm install --prefix app/frontend
npm install --prefix app/backend

# 3. Configure environment variables
cp app/frontend/.env.example app/frontend/.env
cp app/backend/.env.example app/backend/.env

# 4. Start everything (databases + API + frontend)
npm run dev
```

This launches the full stack: **PostgreSQL** databases via Docker Compose, the **Express API** on port 3001, and the **Vite dev server** on port 8080.

Other useful commands:

| Command            | Description                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev:stop` | Stop database containers                |
| `npm run dev:reset`| Wipe database volumes and recreate      |
| `npm run build`    | Build backend then frontend             |
| `npm run test`     | Run Jest (API) + Vitest (frontend)      |
| `npm run lint`     | Lint the frontend                       |

For the complete local development walkthrough — including auth modes, environment variables, and AI model setup — see [Local Development](./docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Configuration: placeholders to replace

This repository ships with **placeholder values** in place of any organization-specific identifiers. To run locally you only need the `.env` files; to deploy to your own Azure tenant you must also replace the placeholders in the static and infrastructure files below with your own values.

**Local development (no cloud needed):** copy the `.env.example` files (see Quick Start) and set `VITE_AUTH_MODE=mock` (frontend) and `SKIP_AUTH=true` (backend) to run the full stack against local Docker Postgres with no Azure account. All secrets in `.env` are yours and are never committed.

**Authentication (Microsoft Entra ID).** Set your real IDs in the env files — backend `ENTRA_TENANT_ID` / `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` (`app/backend/.env`) and frontend `VITE_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` / `VITE_ENTRA_TENANT_ID` (`app/frontend/.env`). Then update the one static file that cannot read env at runtime:

| File | Placeholder | Replace with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/frontend/public/auth-redirect.html` | `clientId` `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111` | your Entra **Application (client) ID** |
| `app/frontend/public/auth-redirect.html` | tenant `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` in the `authority` URL | your Entra **Directory (tenant) ID** |

**API Management policies** (`infra/config/apim-policy.xml`, `apim-policy-minimal.xml`):

| Placeholder | Replace with |
| --- | --- |
| tenant `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` | your Entra **tenant ID** |
| audience `22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222` | your API **app-registration audience** (application ID URI / client ID) |
| `<env-suffix>` in the backend Container Apps FQDN | your deployed Container Apps **environment suffix** |

**Infrastructure.**

- `infra/scripts/New-PbmmSubnets.ps1` — pass `-SubscriptionId <your-subscription-guid>` (the default is the all-zero placeholder).
- `infra/params/*.tfvars` — set your own resource names (the committed `goa-cc-*` names are examples).
- Real secrets (DB passwords, JWT signing key, GitHub App private key) are **never** stored in code or tfvars — they are generated into / read from Key Vault and injected from GitHub Environment secrets at deploy time. See [`docs/PBMM_DEPLOYMENT.md`](./docs/PBMM_DEPLOYMENT.md).

**Operations runbooks** (`docs/operations/*`): private IPs are shown as `10.x.y.z` and environment-specific hostnames as `<env-suffix>` — substitute your environment's actual values when following those guides.
